# UBS Hackathon Legal Tech Titan
## Description

The UBS_Hackathon_Legal_Tech_Titan project seeks to transform how users engage with legal documents. With our system, users can pose specific legal inquiries, and in turn, it intelligently identifies and presents the top N most pertinent legal documents related to the query.

Beyond merely presenting these documents, we've integrated a dynamic Q&A chatbot that facilitates deeper interaction with the content. Additionally, our system offers the capability to succinctly summarize these documents, making legal research more efficient and user-friendly.

This repository serves as a **prototype** of our envisioned end solution. For the purposes of this prototype, we operate under the assumption that the document retrieval phase is already completed. The primary focus here is on the Q&A chatbot functionality and the document summarization capabilities.

## Installation & Requirements

conda create --name UBS_hackathon python=3.10.6
